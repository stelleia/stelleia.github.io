My final project is a personal website that includes galleries with and information regarding creative or "professional" work I've done. I wanted to be able to use a site where I can introduce myself and present the kind of work I'm passionate about to friends, family, and potential employers who might be curious.

I used the "Work" page to feature the projects that I've worked on for internships, organizations, and coursework, and the "Play" page to feature some 35mm photographs I've taken for leisure. My homepage doubles as my "About" page. 

The two extra elements I included were a contact form (on "Say hi") and an iframe to highlight a zine that I made on the "Work" page.
